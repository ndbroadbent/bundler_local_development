# Bundler - Local Development

### Provides a simple way to switch between local and installed gems.

Since this gem overrides bundler itself, it is installed and required in an unusual way.
It is required *within* your Gemfile, and is not meant to be used in your application.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'bundler_local_development', :group => :development, :require => false
    begin
      require 'bundler_local_development'
      # Set up the list of gems that should be used when they are found in your local gem directory.
      # Remove this line to always load local gems when possible.
      Bundler.development_gems = [/foo/, 'bar', /baz/]
    rescue LoadError
    end

And then install the gem with:

    $ bundle

or:

    gem install bundler_local_development


## Usage

Call `Bundler.development_gems = [...]` in your Gemfile, to configure your default set of local gems.
You can provide regular expressions or strings to match gem names.
You can also use `[:all]` to disable filtering and load all local gems if they exist.

The reasoning behind these filters is that you might have a lot of gems in your local gem directory,
and it would be hard to make sure that they all have the correct version checked out.

### Environment Variables

You can set the `$DEV_GEMS` environment variable to add extra gems to this list (semicolon separated list of gem names).

If the `$GEM_DEV` environment variable is unset, this gem will have no effect.

If the `$GEM_DEV` environment variable is set:

## Loading local gems

Bundler will search for local gems in the
path specified by `$GEM_DEV_DIR`. (The default search path is `$HOME/code/gems`, if `$GEM_DEV_DIR` is unset.)
You can specify multiple directories by separating paths with a semicolon, e.g.
`$HOME/code/gems;$HOME/code/more_gems`

If a local copy of the gem is found, it will add the `:path => <path>`
option to the `gem` command.

It will scan the local gem's `gemspec` and process any runtime dependencies.
It will also load and evaluate the local gem's `Gemfile`. The Gemfile will have any `source` or `gemspec` lines stripped, as well as removing the `rake` gem. (I found that `rake` was most likely to be pegged at different versions.

Note that `Gemfile.lock` will **NOT** be updated if this gem is activated.


## Shell shortcut

In order to make the most of this gem, you need a quick way to enable or disable it.

Add the following function to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# Gem development shortcuts
# Toggle between gem development and production mode
# (Set / unset $GEM_DEV variable)
gdv() {
  local flag_var="GEM_DEV"
  if env | grep -q "^$flag_var="; then
    unset $flag_var
  else
    export $flag_var=true
  fi
}
```

Now you will be able to enable or disable the gem by typing: `gdv`


## Indicator in Shell Prompt

Finally, you might want to know whether or not the gem is enabled.

Add the following function to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# When developing gems ($GEM_DEV is exported), display a hammer and pick
parse_gem_development() {
  if env | grep -q "^GEM_DEV="; then echo "\[\e[0;33m\]âš’ "; fi
}
```

Then, use `$(parse_gem_development)` to display the indicator in your prompt.
